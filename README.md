# 230fall-Katera-Griffiths--Project-4

This interactive webpage project will be about discovering uncommon words in the English language. 
Each page will feature a unique word that goes along with the background image. The cursor on the page
will be surrounded by target circles that will align with each other once the user hovers over a specific location
on the page. There will be an effect to notify that the user has hovered over the right spot. The user can click at the location
which will prompt the word to appear and perform an animation. Finally, the definition of the word will appear in a modal-like window 
on the page. There will be a simple navigation menu so it won't distract from the content.

Iâ€™ll need to learn how to do parallax effects with JavaScript to apply to the background images and the graphics that will hover with the mouse movement. I will also need to know how to call function based on mouse position. For most of the interaction can rely on JavaScript, jQuery and CSS.
